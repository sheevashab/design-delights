# Design Delights: Project Overview

## Project Description

Design Delights emulates an interactive design blog. I will use Airtable to make an API that will create the starting content on the blog, but users will be able to add and delete their own content as well once the site is deployed. The MVP for this project covers the "art" portion of the blog, but with post-MVP I would like to include fashion, interiors, and architecture as additional segments.

## MVP/PostMVP 

### MVP 
My project 2 MVPs are:
- Create a React application with 6 components: a nav bar, an e-mail submit form, a list of artworks, a detail page for a specific piece of art, a user submit form for user to add an artwork to the list, and a delete compontent for a user to be able to delete an artwork from the page.
- Make an API in Airtable
- Employ an axios get, axios post, and axios delete request via Airtable
- Design mobile-first application, with media-query for desktop 
- Use CSS library TailwindCSS to style the project

### PostMVP  
My project 2 PostMVPs are:
- Add links and components for fashion, interiors and architecture pages that will also allow to user to view, add, and delete their chosen content

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
Design Delights excels visually in its cohesive styling. I enjoyed the process of creating a color palette and meticulously following the same set of visual design cues, which I believe creates a better user experience. Furthermore, this project successfully employs axios calls for all but one of the CRUD functions.

### Weaknesses:
I struggled using TailwindCSS to style this project. Namely, I had a hard time using their flex styling to arrange the content on the page as desired. Additionally, I have a lot of repetitive code between my four design categories. I would like to revisit this project in the future and attempt to write DRY-er code.

### Opportunities:
The layout for this project leaves room to expand, both in terms of the content on each page and the possible categories to add to. There is also the opportunity to refine my code with less repetition in the future.

### Threats:
One threat to the continuation of Design Delights is the potential variation in the contents's imagery. The difference in size (length vs width) made it difficult to figure out a singular style that would apply well to every image.
