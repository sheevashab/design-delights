# Design Delights: Project Overview

## Project Description

Design Delights emulates an interactive design blog. I will use Airtable to make an API that will create the starting content on the blog, but users will be able to add and delete their own content as well once the site is deployed. The MVP for this project covers the art page of the blog, but with post-MVP I would like to include fashion, interiors, and architecture as pages.

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

## Component Hierarchy

## MVP/PostMVP 

### MVP 
My project 2 MVPs are:
- Create a React application with 6 components: a nav bar, a home page, an e-mail submit form, a list of artworks, a user submit for user to add an artwork to the list, and a delete compontent for a user to be able to delete an artwork from the page.
- Employ an axios get, axios post, and axios delete request via Airtable
- Make an API in Airtable
- Design mobile-first application, with media-query for desktop 
- Use CSS library, grid, or flexbox (unsure of which I will use at the moment)

### PostMVP  
My project 2 PostMVPs are:
- Add links and components for fashion, interiors and architecture pages that will also allow to user to add and delete their chosen content
